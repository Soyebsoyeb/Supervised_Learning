2nd Model Spam Email Classifier

A robust spam email classification system using advanced NLP techniques and machine learning, designed to handle real-world data challenges with multiple fallback mechanisms.


üõ†Ô∏è Robust Text Processing
Multi-stage cleaning: URL removal, email pattern removal, HTML stripping
Resilient tokenization: Falls back to simple tokenizer if NLTK fails
Lemmatization: Uses WordNet for word normalization
Error handling: Gracefully processes malformed text


üìä Data Pipeline
Automatic dataset acquisition: Downloads from GitHub with local fallback
Synthetic data generation: Creates training data if downloads fail
Feature engineering: Message length, word count, and TF-IDF features


ü§ñ Machine Learning
Multiple classifiers: Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and SVM
Model evaluation: ROC AUC, confusion matrices, classification reports
Error-resistant training: Isolated model training with fallbacks
